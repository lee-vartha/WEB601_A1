# WEB601_A1

Assessment introduction:
In this assessment, you will use Node.js to develop a RESTful API that demonstrates key web application functionalities
such as handling requests and responses, handling HTTP methods, and implementing middleware for server
functionality. This assessment assesses your ability to use theoretical understanding in real-world web development,
particularly in server-side Node.js programming. By completing this assessment, you will meet the learning outcome
(LO1) of applying the fundamentals of web applications, including HTTP, and demonstrate that you are knowledgeable
in developing web functionality on the server.

Objective:
Design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a
resource of your choice (e.g., products, books, users). The API should be able to handle different HTTP requests (GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE) and return appropriate responses to the client.


1. Resource Selection and Data Structure
1.1 Select and Explain Your Chosen Resource: Choose a resource (e.g., products, books, users) for your API.
Explain your choice, detailing how it will be used to demonstrate the application of web functionalities on
the server. (Recommended words 500 -700 with screenshots)
1.2 Develop and Analyses the Data Structure: Develop a JSON schema for your chosen resource, including at
least four attributes. Analyses the structure's suitability for HTTP communication and its efficiency in
representing data for web functionalities.
